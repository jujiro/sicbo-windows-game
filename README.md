Learn C# and object oriented programming by building the ancient Chinese game of Sic Bo.

Watch a few YouTube videos to learn the game, if you don't know it already.  Download the solution.  Go through the code.  Many years ago, I taught myself C#, .Net, and object oriented programming by writing this game.  The code sucks by modern standards but is still worth learning from.
